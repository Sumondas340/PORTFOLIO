<div class="about">
  <p><h4>I am a person,<br>Who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see and to experience.</p><p><h4>I like to read, write, think, dream, talk & listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning & moonlight at night, like to listen music flowing on my face, feel the smell of the wind coming from the ocean.<br><br>
   I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, like to do experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn and snow in winter. I like to sleep early &  get up late. I like to be alone & sometimes be surrounded by people. 
 I like country’s peace, delicious food and comfortable shoes. I like good books and romantic movies, the land and the nature. At last, obviously I like to laugh.</h4></p>
